I have downloaded dataset locally from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacksoncrow/stock-market-dataset because of large dataset i am not able to upload to github.


Then After extracting i got 2 folders etfs and stocks and one symbols meta csv file. 

I loaded into problem 1 and got data.parquet file again its large so i didnt uploaded to github then I got newdataset.paquet from problem 2 and then i generated model file from problem 3 which i used for api.

There is 4 files

1. Problem1, Problem2, Problem3, Problem4
